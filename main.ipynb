The NBER's definition -- which hasn't changed -- requires economic downturn across the economy in a broad sense.  We probably can't have a recession and very low unemployment at the same time.  So if we have a recession, we will have layoffs, too. [deleted] Most layoffs I've seen headlines for are in tech. While tech is a huge sector, it is important to look at the market as a whole. Job growth and job demand is still high. There are many many different indicators people look at. Housing prices is another. The difference between the bond curve. 3 month compared to the 1 year is another common one. When that inverts it means the economy isn't in a great place.

Housing industry is going to get hit this winter and even spring.   Be honest with ourselves we have been in recession most of the year.  Not too many mfg jobs are in the US so you do not see that many job losses.\\n\\nAfter Xmas I imagine companies like mail order delivery will slow down also. Your pocketbook. Negative GDP, inflation, decrease in purchases, growing unemployment... decrease of consumer spending; and increase of umemployment Honestly fear of a recession is the best indicator.

Not to mention the fact that oil is going up again. Which was a big factor in how we got to 8% - 9% inflation in the first place. Gas is almost $6 in my area now. More than it has ever been where I live. We are at the beginning of a lot of pain. Not the middle or the end. Recession is here, and it will deepen and broaden until everyone finally sees it. I mean australia raised under expectations but I dont think  that matter I think the jump was - Australia only bumped by 25 basis pts and for some reason the market is in love with the fed pivot idea, jobs openings reduced something like 10%, Bond yields went down as well.
